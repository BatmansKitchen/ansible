Ansible playbooks for CCDC/CTF machines

== About Ansible
Ansible is a python thing that uses only SSH to setup machines remotely, or
python to set up a local machine. Machine states are described using yaml (yaml
= yet another markup language) and ansible does the smallest amount of work
possible to get them to that state.

== How these are useful
These are ansible roles that are resuable descriptions of machines. For
example, a pen-testing role with a bunch of offensive tools. Another could be a
secure mail server, another an apache server, and so on. From these, it becomes
easy to point at a machine and say "act like this" theoretically making it
trivial to spin up useful machines.

== Setup to use
If you're running it on the localhost, install ansible and its dependencies
first, then run a playbook assigning the desired role to localhost.
